<h3>Setting: <u>Monster Storage</u></h3></br>
In the right side of the arena, there is a series of tunnels leading to holding cells for monsters.</br>
The tunnels form a non-complex maze.</br>
Most cells are open and empty. TODO: How are the cells sealed?</br>
Several cells in the farther back have blood splatered on the floor/walls.</br>
Traversing to the back cells, a monster is sleeping, injured.</br></br>
Trigger: Walking near the monster.</br>
Result: The monster wakes up and--stumbleing--chases the protagonist,</br>
attacking if it gets within range.</br></br>
Trigger: Protagonist leaves cells while Monster is chasing them.</br>
Result: Monster will go back to the back cell and sleep.</br>

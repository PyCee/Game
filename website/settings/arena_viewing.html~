<h3>Setting: <u>Arena Viewing</u></h3>
There is a hole in the back-left wall of the arena.</br>
To the right and forward there is the prison.</br>
To the left, there is a corridor through the rock. Torches align the walls.</br>
At the end of the corridor, the path turns to the right and slopes up.</br>
It leads to another corridor that follows the wall of the arena.</br>
Holes in the side of the wall allow light to enter the corridor.</br>
The corridor leads to a similar turn-away from the arena and</br>
up slope as before. The rest of the corridors follow this pattern to the top,</br>
where there is an opening to the top of the cliff.<

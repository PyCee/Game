<h3>Setting: <u>Hand of God</u></h3>
There is a giant hand reaching out of the sand to the sky.</br>
The fingers are curved upwards.</br>
The sand creates a mountain--which can be climbed--that reaches the hand</br>
between fingers 2 and 3.</br>
Camera: When climbing, tilt upwards so sand mound fills the</br>
bottom 35% of screen, with fingers also in view.</br>
There is a nuber of beautiful desert plants in the palm of the hand.<br>

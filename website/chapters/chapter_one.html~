<h2> Chapter One</h2></br>
Chapter One starts with the <a href="/monsters/protagonist.html">Protagonist</a> wandering desert dunes.</br></br>
<i id="desert">Setting: <u>Desert</u></br>
Surrounded by sand and sun. There is a cliff in the distance.</br>
End Setting: <u>Desert</u></br></br></i>
<i>Trigger: Movement to certain area</br>
Result: Monsters appear to fight the protagonist</br></br>
~Start basic fighting tutorial~</br></br>
Trigger: 25% Monsters Defeated</br>
Result: Sandstorm Appears</br></br></i>
While moving forward, cliff walls (of which the protagonist is at the bottom)</br>
come together and force the protagonist to a certain area.</br></br>
<i id="sand_arena">Setting: <u>Sand Arena</u></br>
The walls widen out to form a large circle(arena).</br>
The sand is blown down from the right slope. It is piled up in the</br>
 ____(left or right. look to physics) side of the circle.</br>
The right wall slopes out steeply(about 75 degrees out of circle).</br>
As the wall goes around the circle, it slopes into the circle (about 80 degrees) on the left.</br>
End Setting: <u>Sand Arena</u></br></br></i>
<i id="arena_viewing">Setting: <u>Arena Viewing</u></br>
There is a hole in the back-right wall of the arena.</br>
Inside the opening, there is a split. To the left, there is a weapons room.</br>
There are only several weapons in it, with plenty of weapon racks.</br>
To the right, there is a corridor through the rock. Torches align the walls.</br>
At the end of the corridor, the path turns to the left and slopes up.</br>
It leads to another corridor that follows the wall of the arena.</br>
Holes in the side of the wall allow light to enter the corridor.</br>
The corridor leads to a similar turn-away from the arena and</br>
up slope as before. The rest of the corridors follow this pattern to the top,</br>
where there is an opening to the top of the cliff.</br>
End Setting: <u>Arena Viewing</u></br></br></i>
<i id="monster_cells">Setting: <u>Monster Cells</u></br>
In the left side of the arena, there is a series of tunnels leading to holding cells for monsters.</br>
The tunnels form a non-complex maze.</br>
Most cells are open and empty.</br>
Several cells in the farther back have blood splatered on the floor/walls.</br>
Traversing to the back cells, a monster is sleeping.</br></br>
Trigger: Walking near the monster.</br>
Result: The monster wakes up and lazily chases the protagonist,
</br>attacking if it gets within range.</br></br>
Trigger: Protagonist leaves cells while Monster is chasing them.</br>
Result: Monster will go back to the back cell and sleep.</br></br>
End Setting: <u>Monster Cells</u></br></br></i>
<i>Trigger: Movement into arena.</br>
Result: Sandstorm lessens to the point where the other side of the arena is somewhat visible.</br></br></i>

Follow near the entrance to a long tunnel.</br>
Monster is defeated, and the storm pushes the protagonist into the tunnel.</br>
The protagonist won't walk back out into the storm.</br>
While walking throught the tunnel, a large <a href="/monsters/heat_demon.html">Heat Demon</a> comes from the entrance.</br>
The demon makes a loud noise and chases the Protgonist.</br></br>
The tunnel opens up, over looking a large cavern.</br>
<h3>Setting: <a name="cavern_market_p" href="/settings/cavern_market.html">Cavern Market</a></h3>
Two paths wind down to the cavern floor from the tunnel exit.</br>
The paths wind down and clockwise/counter-clockwise.</br>
The cavern bottom is a circle with a market set-up.</br>
The Heat Demon fight occurs here.</br>
</br>
The cavern floor has numerous tunnels leading to various other rooms,</br>
such as the <a href="/settings/throne_room.html">Throne Room</a>, the <a href="/settings/animal_pen.html">Animal Pen</a>, and the <a href="/settings/wine_cellar.html">Wine Cellar</a></br>
The large entrence to the wine cellar is locked.</br> A large pully mechanism is locked, and no key is found.</br>
The cavern floor also leads to a large area that houses some broken transport.</br>
The other side of the area to a (very) large gate with a pully mechanism (also locked)</br>

<h3>Setting: <a name="throne_room_p" href="/settings/throne_room.html">Throne Room</a></h3>
The protagonist enters the throne room looking at the two thrones.</br>
Sitting on the left throne is a <a href="/monsters/sand_demon.html">Sand Demon</a> with it's sword on the throne to it's left.</br>
The Sand Demon rises, and a fight ensues.</br>
TODO: more</br>
After several hits, the Sand Demon's sword is knocked out of it's hand and the sword loses it's shape, as sand.</br>
The Sand Demon escapes to <a href="/settings/animal_storage.html">Animal Storage</a> via a conjoining room.</br>
Having lost it's sword, the Sand Demon must adapt.</br>
It will fight with the bones of the animals that died here.</br>
The fight takes place through several areas, eack previously held a different animal.</br>
</br>
The Sand Demon escapes to <a href="/settings/wine_cellar.html">Wine Cellar</a> via a conjoining room.</br>
Here, the Sand Demon does not fight. It constantly runs around the large kegs of wine and hides.</br>
To defeat it, the protagonist must break many wine barrels so the floor is flooded.</br>
This breaks down the lower part the Sand Demon so the protagonist can finish the job.</br>
The gate key is found in the remains.</br>
</br>
The gate to exit the caverns is unlocked by the key.</br>
The protagonist operates the pully and runs through before the gate drops down behind.</br>
There is a slope in front of the protagonist, leading up to a large hand, palm up towards the sun.</br>

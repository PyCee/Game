<i>Save</i></br>
The Protagonist must chase the last monster of the group that has run away.</br>
Follow near the entrance to a long tunnel.</br>
Monster is defeated, and the storm pushes the protagonist into the tunnel.</br>
The protagonist won't walk back out into the storm.</br>
While walking throught the tunnel, a large <a href="/monsters/heat_demon.html">Heat Demon</a> comes from the entrance.</br>
The demon makes a loud noise and chases the Protgonist.</br></br>
The tunnel opens up, over looking a large cavern.</br>
<div class="setting">Setting: <a name="cavern_market_p" href="/settings/cavern_market.html">Cavern Market</a></div>
Two paths wind down to the cavern floor from the tunnel exit.</br>
The paths wind down and clockwise/counter-clockwise.</br>
The cavern bottom is a circle with a market set-up.</br>
The Heat Demon fight occurs here.</br>
</br>
The cavern floor has numerous tunnels leading to various other rooms,</br>
such as the <a href="/settings/throne_room.html">Throne Room</a> and the <a href="/settings/wine_cellar.html">Wine Cellar</a></br>
The entrence to the wine cellar is a gate large enough for a cart to pass through.</br>
The pully mechanism used to open the gate is locked, and no key is found.</br>
The cavern floor also leads to a large area that houses some broken transport.</br>
The other side of the area is a gate 5 carts wide, with a pully mechanism (also locked)</br>
<div class="setting">Setting: <a name="throne_room_p" href="/settings/throne_room.html">Throne Room</a></div>
The protagonist enters the throne room looking at the two thrones.</br>
Sitting on the left throne is a <a href="/monsters/sand_prince.html">Sand Prince</a> with it's sword on the throne to it's left.</br>
The Sand Prince rises, and a fight ensues.</br>
TODO: more</br>
After several hits, the Sand Prince's sword is knocked out of it's hand and the sword loses it's shape, as sand.</br>
The Sand Prince escapes to the wine cellar via a conjoining room.</br>
<div class="setting">Setting: <a name="wine_cellar_p"href="/settings/wine_cellar.html">Wine Cellar</a></div>
Here, the Sand Prince does not fight. It constantly runs around the large kegs of wine and hides.</br>
To defeat it, the protagonist must break many wine barrels so the floor is flooded.</br>
This breaks down the lower part the Sand Prince so the protagonist can finish the job.</br>
The gate key is found in the remains.</br></br>
<div class="setting">Setting: <a name="god_stairs_p" href="/settings/god_stairs.html">God Stairs</a></div>
The pully mechanism for the gate to exit the caverns is unlocked by the key.</br>
The protagonist operates the pully, but is unable to lift the gate high enough.</br>
After seconds of trying to operate the pully, a Sand King lifts the gate from the other side.</br>
The protagonist runs through before the Sand King drops the gate.</br>
Comence battle with the <a href="/monsters/sand_king.html">Sand King</a>.</br>

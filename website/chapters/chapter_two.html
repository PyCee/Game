<h2> Chapter Two</h2></br>

Protagonist grabs a bag of supplies from the boat.</br>
Protagonist jumps off of the boat onto a floating piece of ice.</br>
he jumps from each piece of ice to the next.</br>
Once the Protagonist gets to the mainland, a shelter must be found.</br>
(search comences)</br></br>
<h3>Setting: <a href="/setting/ice_cavern.html">Ice Cavern</a></h3>
The Protagonist finds an ice cave with a large entrance that winds</br>
throughout a series of tunnels and is protected from the chill winds.</br>
In the area there is a monster with it's two children, feeding.</br>
The monster comes after the Protagonist while the two children stay behind.</br>
The Protagonist fights the monster throughout the tunnels leading to the outside.</br>
(fight ensues)</br></br>
</i>Trigger: The mother monster is defeated</br>
Result: One of the children begins to eat the other</br></br></i>
return to the cavern to find one of the children eating the corpse of the other,</br>
the corpse being ripped apart.</br>
If the Protagonist attempts to lure it into the tight tunnels,</br>
the moster will return to eating the other.</br>
(fight ensues)</br></br>
Once the moster is defeated, the Protagonist can relax.</br>
The supply bag is set down and a large shadow is seen underneth the thin ice of the cavern floor.</br>
Following the direction the shadow traveled,</br>
the Protagonist comes out of the cavern and must jump the ice on the way back to the boat.</br>
While the sections of ice are being jumped upon,</br>
the creature partially surfaces and moves the various ice blocks.</br>
The Protagonist is stuck on an ice block that has floaten away from the body of the rest.</br>
The ice continues to float away and the monster does not surface again.</br></br>
(how does the player know to do this?)</br>
The Protagonist drops the chain into the water and it trails behind.</br>
After 20-30 seconds the Protagonist is dragged by the chain into the water.</br>
Climbing the chain leads to the water monster.</br>
Climb enough and get a hold on the monsters</br>
(insert monster body part that protrudes)(fin?)(stab between ribs with sword and hold that?).</br></br>
Can direct monster by pulling chain.</br></br>
<i>To pull chain use the buttons that normally cause an attack with the chain.</i></br></br>
(fight/travel ensues)</br></br>
The monster can only be pulled to the up and (right/left), as the chain</br>
goes around the monster only on one side.</br>
(objects to crash the monster into?)</br>
Pulling the monster up enought can cause it to jump out of the water into the air(how does this do damage?)</br>
After the defeat conditions are met, the moster crashes into a wall of ice.</br>
The collision throws the Protagonist off, and with the Protagonist automatically swiming upwards,</br>
using the direction controls, must swim to the ice's edge.</br>
Climbing onto the ice, the Protagonist searches around for the shelter.</br>
<h3>Setting: <a href="/setting/blizzard.html">Blizzard</a></h3>
As the protagonist enters a large open area a blizzard begins.</br>
Visibility drops dramatically.</br>
Traveling very far in any direction leads to large ice walls going up as far as the Protagonist can see.</br>
The Protagonist comes accross several primitive establishments in the area surrounded by ice walls.</br>
Monsters attack as the Protagonist searches.</br></br>
The monsters include:</br>
Ice Wolves that come out of the blizzard.</br>
Ice Golems that spawn inside of the Protagonist's view.</br>
The Golem's spawn takes about 2-3 seconds to gather the ice mass together and form,</br>
and if the Protagonist attacks the mass during the spawn, the Golem shatters.</br></br>
In the center of the blizzard is a being which is spawning the monsters.</br>
The Protagonist must run at the being, and shatter the</br>
numerous Ice Golems that spawn in front of the Protagonist.</br>
As the Protagonist attacks the being, the being (does something to the Protagonists dominant arm/side).</br>
The being shatters.</br></br>
The Protagonist must limp up a mountain while fighting monsters.</br>
(details)</br>
Once the Protagonist gets to the mountain's top, the Protagonist</br>
falls down the mountain, tumbling down the snow.</br>
The Protagonist blacks out.</br></br>
The Protagonist regains conciousness while being shouldered by a hooded figure.</br>
The hooded figure brings the Protagonist to the cavern that the Protagonist previouisly cleared.</br>
There are more supplies in the cavern than previously left by the Protagonist.</br>
The hooded figure takes off hood and nurses the Protagonist for some time.</br>
The Protagonist's dominant arm has been frostbitten off.</br>
The Protagonist and the savior leave on the savior's boat.</br>

<h2> Chapter Two</h2></br>

Protagonist grabs a bag of supplies from the boat.</br>
Protagonist jumps off of the boat onto a floating piece of ice.</br>
he jumps from each piece of ice to the next.</br>
Once the Protagonist gets to the mainland, a shelter must be found.</br>
(search comences)</br></br>
<h3>Setting: <a name="ice_cavern_p" href="/settings/ice_cavern.html">Ice Cavern</a></h3>
The Protagonist finds an ice cave with a large entrance.</br>
The supply bag is set down and a large shadow is seen underneth the thin ice of the cavern floor.</br>
Following the direction the shadow traveled,</br>
the Protagonist comes out of the cavern and must jump the ice on the way back to the boat.</br>
While the sections of ice are being jumped upon,</br>
the creature partially surfaces and moves the various ice blocks.</br>
The Protagonist is stuck on an ice block that has floaten away from the body of the rest.</br>
The ice continues to float away and the monster does not surface again.</br></br>
(TODO: how does the player know to do this?)</br>
The Protagonist drops the chain into the water and it trails behind.</br>
After 20-30 seconds the Protagonist is dragged by the chain into the water.</br>
Climbing the chain leads to the <a name="shark_p" href="/monsters/shark.html">Giant Shark</a>.</br>
Climb enough and get a hold on the monsters</br>
(insert monster body part that protrudes)(fin?)(stab between ribs with sword and hold that?).</br></br>
Can direct monster by pulling chain.</br></br>
<i>To pull chain use the buttons that normally cause an attack with the chain.</i></br></br>
(fight/travel ensues)</br></br>
The monster can only be pulled to the up and (right/left), as the chain</br>
goes around the monster only on one side.</br>
(objects to crash the monster into?)</br>
Pulling the monster up enought can cause it to jump out of the water into the air(how does this do damage?)</br>
After the defeat conditions are met, the moster crashes into a wall of ice.</br>
The collision throws the Protagonist off, and with the Protagonist automatically swiming upwards,</br>
using the direction controls, must swim to the ice's edge.</br>
Climbing onto the ice, the Protagonist searches around for the shelter.</br>
<h3>Setting: <a name="blizzard_p" href="/settings/blizzard.html">Blizzard</a></h3>
As the protagonist enters a large open area a blizzard begins.</br>
Visibility drops dramatically.</br>
Traveling very far in any direction leads to large ice walls going up as far as the Protagonist can see.</br>
The Protagonist comes accross several primitive establishments in the area surrounded by ice walls.</br>
Monsters attack as the Protagonist searches.</br></br>
The monsters include:</br>
<a href="/monsters/ice_wolf.html">Ice Wolves</a> that come out of the blizzard.</br>
<a href="/monsters/ice_golem.html">Ice Golems</a> that spawn inside of the Protagonist's view.</br>
The Golem's spawn takes about 2-5 seconds to gather the ice mass together and form,</br>
and if the Protagonist attacks the mass during the spawn, the Golem shatters.</br></br>
In the center of the blizzard is a being which is spawning the monsters.</br>
The Protagonist must run at the being, and shatter the</br>
numerous Ice Golems that spawn in front of the Protagonist.</br>
As the Protagonist attacks the being, the being (does something to the Protagonists dominant arm/side).</br>
The being shatters.</br></br>
The Protagonist must limp up a mountain while fighting monsters.</br>
There is a tunnel leading to a space with many stalagtites/stalagmites.</br>
The entrance to the area is gaurded by 3-8 monsters.</br>
In the center of the cavern resides a large <a href="/monsters/ice_climber.html">Ice Climber</a>.</br>
TODO: describe fight</br>
Once the Protagonist gets to the mountain's top, the Protagonist</br>
falls down the mountain, tumbling down the snow.</br>
The Protagonist blacks out.</br></br>
The Protagonist regains conciousness while being shouldered by a hooded figure through the blizzard.</br>
Protagonist loses conscoiusness.</br>
The Protagonist reagins consciousness and can crawl around the cavern.</br>
The hooded figure is nowhere to be seen.</br>
There are more supplies in the cavern than previously left by the Protagonist.</br>
After 20-40 seconds the hooded figure enters the cavern carrying the head of the _____ monster.</br>
The hooded figure takes off hood and nurses the Protagonist for some time.</br>

	<h1>Prologue</h1>
	The prologue starts off with the <a href="../characters/char_protagonist.html">Protagonist</a> being </br>
	in a cage in a dimly lit room with one window.</br>
	In the room there is plenty of old furniture convered with sheets</br>
	He can hear a drunk man grumbling to himself, sitting in a rocking chair.</br>
	The man stumbles over and smashes a bottle against the bars.</br></br></br>
	<i>STOP LOOKING AT ME!</br>
	STOP IT!</br>
	GO TO SLEEP!</i></br></br>
	The Protagonist flinches/closes his eyes on reflex.</br>
	-choice "Stop...", "Who are you...", ""</br>
	The man continues to stare for several seconds in silence,</br>
	until he goes back to mumbling to himself in the rocking chair.</br>
	Close eyes to advance to next day.</br>
	Wake up. Rocking chair is empty.</br>
	Hear scratching sound behind him.</br>
	When he turns around he sees a girl,</br>
	about the age of 15-25, in another cage behind him.</br>
	The scratching stops.</br>

	---if ask who she is{</br></br>
		<i>Who...Who are you?</i>}</br></br></br>
	---if silence{</br>
		Nothing happens.}</br>
	Either way, she does not say anything</br>
	and there is silence for set time (15s, enough to build up unease).</br>
	He sees shadows creeping around. Over another 10-15s they get closer</br>
	He must close his eyes to advance to the next day.</br>
	He opens his eyes to the man yelling at the wall angrily.</br>
	
	</br></br></br>
	He opens his eyes to find the cage open.</br>
	He gets out and stands up.</br>

	---required: { Knife on floor next to rocking chair. }</br>
	---optional: { Look out window and see sea. }</br>

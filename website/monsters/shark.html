Fought during <a href="/chapters/chapter_two.html#ocean_p">Chapter Two</a> in the <a href="/settings/ocean.html">Ocean</a>.</br>
The protagonist's chain is stuck in the monster's mouth.</br>
The shark pulls the protagonist underwater and swims.</br>
Climb enough up the chain and attack with the sword to lodge the it in the shark's middle.</br>
This causes mild damage to the monster.</br>
The protagonist will hold onto the sword to stablize self while the rest of the fight ensues.</br>
When the protagonist has a stable hold, can direct monster by pulling chain.</br></br>
Throughout the fight the shark will shake the sword lose.</br>
When this happens the protagonist must climb the chain again to lodge the sword.</br>
</br><i>To pull chain use the buttons that normally cause an attack with the chain.</i></br></br>
Simply attacking with the chain will take a very small part of the monster's health.</br>
The protagonist must pull the shark into a variety of underwater objects to lower it's health.</br>
</br><i>Objects include:</br>
Ice Structures</br>
Giant Squid</br>
Underwater Ship</br>
The Ocean's Floor</br>
Underwater Tunnel's Sides and Floor</br>
</i></br>
At some point, when no structures are in frame, the world will turn and the ocean floor will be above.</br>
The monster will try to swim upward when it passes through an underwater tunnel/some ice structures.</br>
If it succeeds in doing so the protagonist will be crushed between it and the tunnel ceiling.</br></br>
After the it's defeat conditions are met, the shark will shake the protagonist loose once more.</br>
The shark will crash into an ice wall.</br>
The collision throws the Protagonist off to swim up to the ice's edge.</br>

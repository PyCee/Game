< uglyFace (make sure the old was not someone to root for)
	I saw the you that was so filled with spite,
	a being so revolting, and repulsive, and loathsome.
	
	I had the idea of vile, atrocious, red hatred.
	You were this gorgeous design.
	
	But in your last moments, I saw you.
	
	(partial desc)
	
	I saw you behind the mask.
	I saw the person that hid in the darkness.
	
	(partial desc 2)
	
	I have seen the name that gave you hope,
	and I have seen those that destroyed it.
	
	(partial desc 3)
	
	I know of the Pride in your heart.
	I also know how they ripped it apart.
	And then the Pride was left without a home.
	
	
	As you die, I live on.
	This is your story.

# Game
Game in c.

A learning project.

This is a work in progress, nowhere near finished.
This was primaraly made to learn (through experiencing the bad) good habits when working in a large project,
and to learn/impliment various game engine features.

Code quality varies.
While I often work on code I wrote long ago, some of this code was written in the months after I learned how to program.
None of the code in this project is representative of current programming experience.

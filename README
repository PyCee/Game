# Game
Game in c.

A learning project.

This is a work in progress, nowhere near finished.
This was primaraly made to learn (through experiencing the bad) good habits when working in a large project,
and to learn/impliment various game engine features.

Code quality varies.
While I often work on code I wrote long ago, some of this code was written in the months after I learned how to program.
None of the code in this project is representative of current programming experience.

Makes use of a variety of 3D game engine techniques:
	Loading a model from an external file
	Load game options and controls from an external file
	Player input via a keyboard and mouse to move/turn player character
	First person view
	Opengl v2.1 and the programmable pipeline
	After effects to alter the final image:
		black & white
		invert colors
	A back buffer
	Spacial sub-division in the form of octrees

Work in progress:
	Deferred shading
	after effects:
		blur
		color-blind mode
